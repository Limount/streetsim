This was a little side project to get some practice with python. The starting idea was to get an implimentation of the MARLIN-ATSC traffic light algorithm from the University of Toronto, but never made it that far. 

But I got little dots to drive on the right side of the road, stop at lights and navigate their way to their destination. That was kinda cool.
